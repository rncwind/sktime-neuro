OpenNeuro Datasets can be accessed via either git, or via their own downloader tool.
https://github.com/OpenNeuroDatasets
We support downloading them via git, as their tool requires NodeJS as a dependency.
For a more complete experience, please use the OpenNEURO downloader if possible
inside your environment.

An alternate option is via DataLad.
